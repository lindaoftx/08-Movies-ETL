# 08 - Movie Data Analysis (Extract, Transform, Load)

## Overview

The Amazing Prime video team would like to develop an algorithm to predict which low-budget movies will become popular so they can buy the streaming rights for a bargain.

In order to inspire the team and connect witht the local coding community, Amazing Prime is hosting a hackathon. To help prepare for the event, we were tasked with creating an automated pipeline to read, clean, and compile large chunks of data from multiple sources into an SQL database for use by participants. 

Ratings data was used from publicly available sources [IMDb and Kaggle] to allow Amazing Prime's proprietary rating data to remain confidential.
